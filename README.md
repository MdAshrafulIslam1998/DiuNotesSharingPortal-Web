# DiuNotesSharingPortal-Web
A simple Python  made web application for sharing study materials to make our student life easier

# Abstract
We decided to work on a very innovative 
and creative idea which is a note sharing 
web app made with python and Django. 
As a student of Daffodil International 
University, we always thought if there 
were a supporting hand for us to do help 
with our course materials. After some 
research and discussion, our team finds 
out a great idea. We decided to make a 
portal where all of the students as well as 
teachers of the Daffodil family can be 
connected. Because we can make a 
great community together which is 
enough to make our course materials 
rich. So, we made Diu Notes Sharing 
Portal, where we can share all the 
materials about our courses as well as for 
our educational purpose. A simple web 
app can connect our whole community 
under one roof where we can help 
ourselves for the betterment of our 
community.

# Introduction
DIU Notes Sharing Portal is a solution to 
a common problem for our students. In 
every course, we have to learn a lot of 
things in a short period. Some external 
course materials can help a lot in this 
kind of situation. If we can create a 
connection between our seniors or 
teachers. They can help us a lot with 
these types of course material. So, we 
find out a Technical solution to this 
problem. We will make a web portal for 
the connection between students and 
teachers. With the help of this portal, the 
students can find out various types of 
course materials which is uploaded by 
the seniors and the faculty members. 
Some basic features of these web portals 
are - students and faculty can upload all 
types of files and documents, links, 
images, PDF etc. for the related courses 
and related topics. The users (students) 
can search the topics materials with the 
course's name and can download all the 
materials for those courses. A dedicated 
admin panel will support and judge all the 
file types to maintain the quality of the 
site.

# Objectives and problem 
discussion:
The motivation for this project came from 
a simple problem. To learn better in any
course, we have to learn from other extra 
materials. but the problem is every time 
we do the same work that our seniors 
have already done, which is searching for 
the materials. So, a simple help from our 
seniors can Save a lot of time from our 
courses. The previous notes which have 
been done by our seniors can help a lot. 
The main motivations were - It is tough to 
find out some great sources for external 
materials.
1. It takes a huge time to find out 
these external course materials 
and helpful links
2. There is no such digital method to 
make connections with our 
seniors to take advice for our 
upcoming courses.
3. This coronavirus situation also 
makes it tough communicate with 
our seniors and our faculty 
members.
4. Some good notes and links 
became wasted because there 
is no such kind of places where 
we can store important notes and 
PDF for our juniors.
5. If there were portal for Digital 
solution to store this PDF and 
notes then we would easily access 
them and use for courses.
6. Our faculty members also cannot 
find a great way to share their
materials with lots of students.
7. If there were such kind of portal,
we can find the notes from all 
faculty members. Even if we don’t
get their physical classes.
8. Previous questions are an
important part for the better 
practice of a course.
9. There is no such interactive portal 
to get all the previous year 
questions for our examination
10. Sometimes a Technical solution is 
very effective rather than the 
physical attempt to get notes from 
our faculty members and seniors.

# Related researches
We found some previous works on this 
topic. But none of them is customized for 
a better platform for sharing study 
materials. On the other hand, security is 
a main issue for these kinds of sites. For
example:
“StuDocu” is a platform where you can 
find some study materials but their 
systems are paid.
[1]
“NotesHub” is another platform to share 
study materials. But as their developing 
region is India, they do not follow the 
basic curriculum of our country.
[2]
“Studydrive” is a platform where we also 
can find out notes. But their database is 
not rich & cannot be customizable for our 
own university.
[3]
“Google Drive & Cloud Hosting”, they 
have paid plans after a certain amount of 
data storage and the sharing process is 
almost private.
[4]
So, it is better to make our own web 
portal for our university study material 
sharing community.

# Proposed Method
We are using Python coding language 
and Django for this project. we decided 
to make a web application because web 
application is more accessible to the 
mass population.
1. Language: we used python as 
the developing language of this 
project.
2. Framework: we take Django as 
a data frame work for project. it is 
so popular framework which 
includes python other markup
languages to develop a web
project.
3. Design: we used HTML CSS 
and bootstrap 4 for the design for 
the design purpose of this web 
application
4. Database: we used Django as a 
framework and he created 
database backend for our web 
app.
5. Server: we used 
pythonanywhere server to host 
the web project online. 
pythonanywhere is a free server 
who is give us access to host our 
web application online made with 
Python for free of cost.
6. Making process: Firstly, we 
designed our application with the 
help of HTML CSS and bootstrap 
codes. after that we used Django 
and python to run the web app
correctly. to create the database,
we used Django model class. after 
making the project on our 
localhost we hosted our web on 
pythonanywhere server.
7. Key features: the web 
application has an admin panel. 
admin panel will judge all the 
notes and after that they will 
accept the notes to maintain the 
quality of our website. Students 
have to login to download the 
notes. student or faculty members 
can upload any notes on any 
courses of any topics by creating 
a simple account on the website.

# Discussion
This web application is designed for the 
general user. the UI design is very simple 
to use. Preview and download buttons 
are also provided. the main key feature of 
this web application is the search unit. 
any student can search naming their 
courses, topics, faculty, course code and
many other tags. the file type is also 
described which makes this web 
application more comfortable to use.

# Conclusion:
Our team believes that simple Python 
made web application can change the 
future of the education system for 
Daffodil International University.
